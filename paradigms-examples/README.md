# Procedural Programming
Procedural programming can also be referred to as imperative programming. It is a programming paradigm based upon the concept of procedure calls, in which statements are structured into procedures (also known as subroutines or functions). They are a list of instructions to tell the computer what to do step by step, Procedural programming languages are known as top-down languages. Most of the early programming languages are all procedural.
## Features of Procedural Code
- Procedural Programming is excellent for general-purpose programming
- The coded simplicity along with ease of implementation of compilers and interpreters
- A large variety of books and online course material available on tested algorithms, making it easier to learn.
- The source code is portable
- The code can be reused in different parts of the program, without the need to copy it
- The program flow can be tracked easily as it has a top-down approach.

# Functional Programming
Functional programming is a programming paradigm where you have a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs. Here you treat computation as an evaluation of mathematical functions and you avoid changing-state and mutable data.

Functional programming consists only of PURE functions. So, what do you understand by Pure functions?

Pure functions are those which take an argument list as an input and whose output is a return value. Now you may feel that all functions are pure as any function takes in values and returns a value.

## Features of Functional Paradigm
- Pure functions – As seen above, if the input is an array, the output will be a new array and the input array will not be modified. So in case of pure functions, the output depends only on the input.
- Recursion - A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution. This enables the function to repeat itself several times, the result being outputted at the end of each iteration. Below is an example of a recursive function.
- Referential transparency-An expression is said to be referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior. As a result, evaluating a referentially transparent function gives the same value for fixed arguments. In functional programming, only referentially transparent functions are considered. They are a lot easier to read and understand.
- Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order-A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable. Higher-order functions are functions that take at least one first-class function as a parameter.
- Variables are Immutable-In functional programming you cannot modify a variable after it has been initialized. You can create new variables and this helps to maintain state throughout the runtime of a program.

# Object-Oriented Programming(OO):
In this framework, all real-world entities are represented by Classes. Objects are instances of classes so each object encapsulates a state and behavior. State implies the fields, attributes of the object and behavior is what you do with the state of the object and they are the methods. Objects interact with each other by passing messages.

## Features of OO:
- Encapsulation – This is a fundamental feature of Object-Oriented Programming. Here you hide unnecessary details in classes and deliver a simple and clear interface for working. It describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit. This concept is also often used to hide the internal representation, or state, of an object from the outside
- Inheritance - Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. It is a mechanism where you can derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods. It explains how the class hierarchies develop code readability and support to the reuse of functionality.
- Data Abstraction - to Data abstraction is the reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole. Data abstraction is usually the first step in database design.
- Polymorphism - Polymorphism is an object-oriented programming concept that refers to the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms.
