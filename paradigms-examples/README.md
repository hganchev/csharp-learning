## üéØ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming organizes code around objects and classes, emphasizing encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

### üîç Implementation Highlights

**Location**: `app/OOP/OOPClasses.cs`

Our OOP examples feature a comprehensive vehicle management system that demonstrates:

#### Core OOP Principles

- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with property-based access control and validation
- **Inheritance**: `Car` and `Motorcycle` classes inheriting from abstract `Vehicle` base class
- **Polymorphism**: Different implementations of `Start()` and `Accelerate()` methods
- **Abstraction**: Abstract `Vehicle` class and interface contracts (`IMaintainable`, `IRentable`)

#### Key Classes and Features

```csharp
// Abstract base class with encapsulation
public abstract class Vehicle
{
    private string _brand;           // Encapsulated field
    public string Brand { get; set; } // Property with validation
    public abstract void Accelerate(); // Abstract method
    public virtual void Start() { }    // Virtual method for polymorphism
}

// Inheritance example
public class Car : Vehicle
{
    public override void Start() { /* Car-specific implementation */ }
    public override void Accelerate() { /* Car-specific behavior */ }
}

// Multiple interface implementation
public class RentalCar : Car, IMaintainable, IRentable
{
    // Implements multiple contracts
}
```

#### Real-World Examples

- **Vehicle Management**: Cars, motorcycles with different behaviors
- **Rental System**: Business logic with maintenance scheduling
- **Interface Segregation**: Separate concerns for maintainable and rentable vehicles
- **Enum Usage**: Type-safe constants for vehicle status

### ‚ú® Key Benefits Demonstrated

- **Code Reusability**: Base class provides common functionality
- **Maintainability**: Changes to base class affect all derived classes
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new vehicle types
- **Data Protection**: Private fields prevent unauthorized access
- **Contract Enforcement**: Interfaces ensure consistent implementation

## üßÆ Functional Programming

Functional programming emphasizes pure functions, immutability, and function composition, treating computation as mathematical function evaluation.

### üîç Implementation Highlights

**Location**: `app/Functional/Functions.cs`

Our functional programming examples showcase advanced concepts through practical implementations:

#### Core Functional Concepts

- **Pure Functions**: No side effects, same input always produces same output
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as parameters
- **Function Composition**: Building complex operations from simple functions
- **Immutability**: Data structures that don't change after creation
- **Monadic Patterns**: Safe null handling with Option/Maybe types

#### Key Features Demonstrated

```csharp
// Pure functions
public static int Square(int x) => x * x;
public static bool IsEven(int x) => x % 2 == 0;

// Higher-order function
public static IEnumerable<TResult> Map<T, TResult>(
    IEnumerable<T> source, 
    Func<T, TResult> selector)

// Function composition
public static Func<T, TResult> Compose<T, TIntermediate, TResult>(
    Func<T, TIntermediate> first, 
    Func<TIntermediate, TResult> second)

// Currying
public static Func<int, int> AddCurried(int x) => y => x + y;

// Option monad for safe null handling
public struct Option<T>
{
    public TResult Match<TResult>(Func<T, TResult> onSome, Func<TResult> onNone)
}
```

#### Advanced Examples

- **Memoization**: Caching function results for performance optimization
- **Recursive Functions**: Fibonacci and factorial implementations
- **Mathematical Functions**: Polynomial creation, numerical integration
- **Data Processing**: LINQ-style operations with functional pipelines
- **Option Monad**: Null-safe operations with railway-oriented programming

### ‚ú® Key Benefits Demonstrated

- **Predictability**: Pure functions are easy to test and reason about
- **Concurrency Safety**: Immutable data prevents race conditions
- **Modularity**: Small, composable functions
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Functions behave like mathematical functions
- **Error Handling**: Monadic patterns for safe error propagation

- **Control Structures**: Loops, conditionals, and branching
- **Top-Down Design**: Breaking complex problems into smaller procedures

#### Key Features Demonstrated

```csharp
public class ProceduralExamples
{
    private static List<string> _taskList = new();  // Mutable state
    
    public ProceduralExamples()
    {
        // Sequential execution
        InitializeSystem();
        DisplayWelcomeMessage();
        DemonstrateBasicOperations();
        DemonstrateControlStructures();
        // ... more steps
    }
    
    // Procedure with state modification
    private static void AddTask(string taskDescription)
    {
        string task = $"[{_taskIdCounter}] {taskDescription} - Pending";
        _taskList.Add(task);  // Modifying global state
        _taskIdCounter++;
    }
}
```

#### Real-World Examples

- **Task Management System**: Creating, updating, and tracking tasks
- **Employee Data Processing**: Step-by-step data analysis and reporting

### üîç Implementation Highlights

**Location**: `app/Event_Driven/EventDriven.cs`

Our event-driven examples simulate a complete e-commerce system with multiple interacting services:

#### Core Event-Driven Concepts

- **Publisher-Subscriber Pattern**: Loose coupling between event sources and handlers
- **Event Aggregation**: Centralized event management
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking event handling
- **Event Sourcing**: State changes represented as events
- **Service Communication**: Inter-service communication through events

#### Key Features Demonstrated

```csharp
// Publisher class
public class ECommerceSystem
{
    public event EventHandler<OrderEventArgs>? OrderPlaced;
    public event EventHandler<InventoryEventArgs>? InventoryChanged;
    
    public void PlaceOrder(string orderId, string customerName, decimal amount)
    {
        // Business logic...
        OrderPlaced?.Invoke(this, new OrderEventArgs(orderId, customerName, amount));
    }
}

// Subscriber classes
public class EmailNotificationService
{
    public void Subscribe(ECommerceSystem system)
    {
        system.OrderPlaced += OnOrderPlaced;
        system.OrderShipped += OnOrderShipped;
    }
    
    private void OnOrderPlaced(object? sender, OrderEventArgs e)
    {
        // Send email notification
    }
}
```

        bool continueProgram = true;
        int operationCount = 0;
        
        // Structured control loop
        while (continueProgram && operationCount < 5)
        {
            if (operationCount < 2)
                PerformBasicOperations();    // Module 2
            else if (operationCount < 4)
                PerformDataProcessing();     // Module 3
            else
            {
                PerformCleanupOperations();  // Module 4
                continueProgram = false;
            }
            operationCount++;
